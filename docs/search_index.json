Why am I doing this? Probably because Im a glutton for punishment, and Id rather procrastinate than write my dissertation proposal. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD 1.1 What this book is, and what it is not You know those absolutely amazing, comprehensive guides where you can learn everything you need to know about R? This is is not one of those guides. This book is designed as a quick reference guide for many of the most common things youll need to do in everyday data analysis and research. Think of it like a coding dictionary, as opposed to a manual or comprehensive text. If you want (or need) to learn R in-depth and/or from the ground up (i.e., youre a novice user), then you should go read Hadley Wickhams book and the tidyverse websites. Also, these slides might be a good high-level overview if youve never used the tidyverse before. That said, if youre already familiar with R and the tidyverse and just need a quick reference for what command do I need to accomplish XYZ, youve come to the right place.

If you want a pretty good intro tutorial to the dplyr package, click here 3.1 Joining or Splitting Joining and splitting data is pretty straightforward. 3.1.1 Whole Data Sets The code below is from this excellent tutorial set.seed(2018) df1=data.frame(customer_id=c(1:10), product=sample(c(&#39;toaster&#39;,&#39;TV&#39;,&#39;Dishwasher&#39;),10,replace = TRUE)) df2=data.frame(customer_id=c(sample(df1$customer_id, 5)),state=sample(c(&#39;New York&#39;,&#39;California&#39;),5,replace = TRUE)) df1=tibble::as_tibble(df1) df2=tibble::as_tibble(df2) # df1 =left table # df2= right table Inner join - retains only rows with values that appear in both tables, and matches by keys. If youre joining two Qualtrics surveys together, this is most likely the one you want to use (e.g. matching by participant name, and only keeping rows in the joined data set for participants that have responses logged in both survey 1 and survey 2 df1 %&gt;% inner_join(df2,by=&#39;customer_id&#39;) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## customer_id product state ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Dishwasher New York ## 2 3 Dishwasher New York ## 3 6 toaster New York ## 4 8 Dishwasher New York ## 5 9 Dishwasher New York Left join - returns everything in the left, and rows with matching keys in the right df1 %&gt;% left_join(df2,by=&#39;customer_id&#39;) ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## customer_id product state ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Dishwasher New York ## 2 2 Dishwasher &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 3 Dishwasher New York ## 4 4 toaster &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 5 TV &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 6 toaster New York ## 7 7 toaster &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 8 Dishwasher New York ## 9 9 Dishwasher New York ## 10 10 TV &lt;NA&gt; Right join - returns everything in the right, and rows with matching keys in the left df1 %&gt;% right_join(df2,by=&#39;customer_id&#39;) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## customer_id product state ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Dishwasher New York ## 2 3 Dishwasher New York ## 3 6 toaster New York ## 4 8 Dishwasher New York ## 5 9 Dishwasher New York # note: example if the customer id column was named something different in the second df #df1 %&gt;% left_join(df2,by=c(&#39;customer_id&#39;=&#39;name2&#39;)) Full join - retain all rows from both tables, and join matching keys in both right and left df1 %&gt;% full_join(df2,by=&#39;customer_id&#39;) ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## customer_id product state ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Dishwasher New York ## 2 2 Dishwasher &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 3 Dishwasher New York ## 4 4 toaster &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 5 TV &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 6 toaster New York ## 7 7 toaster &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 8 Dishwasher New York ## 9 9 Dishwasher New York ## 10 10 TV &lt;NA&gt; Anti join - returns all rows in the left that do not have matching keys in the right df1 %&gt;% anti_join(df2,by=&#39;customer_id&#39;) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## customer_id product ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2 Dishwasher ## 2 4 toaster ## 3 5 TV ## 4 7 toaster ## 5 10 TV 3.1.2 Individual Columns/Variables Splitting or joining columns is much easier than doing it to whole data sets. You can use dplyr::separate() to accomplish the former, and dplyr::unite() for the latter. print(&quot;hello&quot;) ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; 3.2 Selecting/extracting specific variables with select() Sometimes when working with a data set, you want to work with a few specific variables. For instance, maybe you want to view a graph of only reverse-coded variables (which start with the prefix r); or maybe you want to create a subset of your data that has a few specific variables removed. For this you can use dplyr::select() and its associated helper commands select() can be thought of as extract; it tells R to identify and extract a specific variable (or variables) cars=mtcars # select one column cars %&gt;% select(mpg) # select multiple columns, if they are all next to one another cars %&gt;% select(mpg:hp) # select multiple columns by name (when not next to one another) by defining them in a vector cars %&gt;% select(c(mpg, hp, wt)) # select only variables that start with a certain prefix/character/pattern/etc. cars %&gt;% select(starts_with(&quot;d&quot;)) # ...or columns that end with a certain prefix/etc. cars %&gt;% select(ends_with(&quot;t&quot;)) # ...or contains a certain pattern or string cars %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;se&quot;)) # select ALL OF the variables in a data set that match those of a pre-defined vector # first define the names in a vector vars=c(&quot;hp&quot;, &quot;drat&quot;, &quot;gear&quot;, &quot;carb&quot;) #now use helper cars %&gt;% select(all_of(vars)) # select ANY OF the variables in a pre-defined vector vars_2=c(&quot;hp&quot;, &quot;drat&quot;, &quot;watermelon&quot;, &quot;grilled_cheese&quot;) # only the first two will be in the data cars %&gt;% select(any_of(vars_2)) # only (and all of) the variables actually PRESENT in the data are pulled # select only variables of a certain class or type cars %&gt;% select(where(is.numeric)) cars %&gt;% select(where(is.character)) Other examples can be seen on THIS LINK for a simple but detailed guide. 3.3 Advanced Filtering techniques All info here and the code taken from this link; credit goes to Suzan Baert. 3.3.1 Filter based on partial match Combine filter with str_detect to search for pattern matches in a column 3.3.2 Filtering based on multiple conditions You can filter for more than one value at once, or combine operators to do searches with conditions. Goal Code Return only rows where both conditions are met filter(condition1, condition2) Return all rows where condition 1 is true but condition 2 is not filter(condition1, !condition2) Return rows where condition 1 and/or condition 2 is met filter(condition1 | condition2) Return all rows where only one of the conditions is met, and not when both are met filter(xor(condition1, condition2) The sample code will return all rows with a bodywt above 100 and either have a sleep_total above 15 or are not part of the Carnivora order. msleep %&gt;% select(name, order, sleep_total:bodywt) %&gt;% filter(bodywt &gt; 100, (sleep_total &gt; 15 | order != &quot;Carnivora&quot;)) 3.3.3 Filtering across multiple columns From Susan Baerts blog page: You have three options for how to do this: filter_all(), which filters columns based on your further instructions filter_if(), which requires a boolean to indicate which columns to filter on. If that is true, the filter instructions will be followed. filter_at(), which requires you to specify columns inside a vars argument for which the filtering will be done. Retain all rows with the pattern match Ca inside. Useful for when you want to search for a key pattern (or number) across multiple columns. msleep %&gt;% select(name:order, sleep_total, -vore) %&gt;% filter_all(any_vars(str_detect(., pattern = &quot;Ca&quot;))) msleep %&gt;% select(name, sleep_total:bodywt) %&gt;% filter_all(any_vars(. &lt; 0.1)) # You can also switch any_vars to all_vars to filter across the whole data frame msleep %&gt;% select(name, sleep_total:bodywt, -awake) %&gt;% filter_all(all_vars(. &gt; 1)) What if you want to filter specific column types in your data frame, like just date columns, to find a specific date across multiple date columns? Or filter across multiple number columns to find every instance of a specific number? filter_if is better than filter_all here because the latter would return a filter search across the whole data frame. By using filter_if, we can get more specific about which columns to search through. msleep %&gt;% select(name:order, sleep_total:sleep_rem) %&gt;% filter_if(is.character, any_vars(is.na(.))) The last command, filter_at, does things differently. It doesnt filter all columns at once; and you do not have to specify the column type or which columns. This one allows you to indicate which columns to search through like you would within any select statement. Example: Search through the columns that start with sleep, for values in all of those columns above .5. msleep %&gt;% select(name, sleep_total:sleep_rem, brainwt:bodywt) %&gt;% filter_at(vars(contains(&quot;sleep&quot;)), all_vars(.&gt;5)) 3.4 If-then and Case-when 3.4.1 If-then The premise of an if/then or if/else statement is simple: If condition 1 is satisfied, perform x operation; if not, then do y mtcars %&gt;% mutate(power_level=ifelse(mtcars$hp&lt;350, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;High&quot;)) %&gt;% head() ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb power_level ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 Low ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 Low ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 Low ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 Low ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 Low ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 Low This line of code effectively says: if the length in Sepal.Length is &gt;5, set new variable = to short; else, set it to long 3.4.2 Case-when When you have 3+ conditions, its easier to use case-when. This is a more simple and straightforward approach than nesting multiple if-else commands My_vector= case_when( Condition1 ~ value1, Condition2 ~ value2, Condition3 ~ value3 TRUE ~ valueForEverythingElse #catch all for things that don&#39;t meet the above conditions ) Example: mtcars %&gt;% mutate(size= case_when(cyl==4 ~ &quot;small&quot;, cyl==6 ~ &quot;medium&quot;, cyl==8 ~ &quot;large&quot;)) %&gt;% select(c(cyl,size)) %&gt;% head() ## cyl size ## Mazda RX4 6 medium ## Mazda RX4 Wag 6 medium ## Datsun 710 4 small ## Hornet 4 Drive 6 medium ## Hornet Sportabout 8 large ## Valiant 6 medium 3.5 Conditional replacement of values The following code is useful if you want to replace a value in one column, and the replacement is conditional upon the value in another column. mpg %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = c(displ, cty, hwy), .fns = ~case_when(cyl == 4L ~ as.numeric(NA), TRUE ~ as.numeric(.x)))) ## # A tibble: 234 x 11 ## manufacturer model displ year cyl trans drv cty hwy fl class ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 audi a4 NA 1999 4 auto(l5) f NA NA p compact ## 2 audi a4 NA 1999 4 manual(m5) f NA NA p compact ## 3 audi a4 NA 2008 4 manual(m6) f NA NA p compact ## 4 audi a4 NA 2008 4 auto(av) f NA NA p compact ## 5 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 auto(l5) f 16 26 p compact ## 6 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 manual(m5) f 18 26 p compact ## 7 audi a4 3.1 2008 6 auto(av) f 18 27 p compact ## 8 audi a4 quattro NA 1999 4 manual(m5) 4 NA NA p compact ## 9 audi a4 quattro NA 1999 4 auto(l5) 4 NA NA p compact ## 10 audi a4 quattro NA 2008 4 manual(m6) 4 NA NA p compact ## # ... with 224 more rows test %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = c(rank), .fns = ~case_when(is.na(participant_score) ~ as.numeric(NA), TRUE ~ as.numeric(.x)))) 3.6 Merging variables Sometimes youll have multiple variables and you want to collapse them into a single variable. The pmin() command is useful for this. example_data=tribble(~A,~B,~C, 1,NA,NA, 2,NA,NA, 3,NA,NA, NA,4,NA, NA,5,NA, NA,6,NA, NA,NA,7, NA,NA,8, NA,NA,9) example_data %&gt;% mutate(accept_reject = pmin(A,B,C,na.rm = TRUE)) 3.7 Apply a function to multiple variables at once You can either specify each column individually, like above, or tell R to identify columns for you based on their type or their name. This requires adding in one additional verbeither contains() or where() depending on what you want to do. Two simple examples: # turn multiple variables into factors ex_data=dplyr::tribble(~color, ~car, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;corvette&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;chevelle&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;camaro&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;corvette&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;chevelle&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;gto&quot;) dplyr::glimpse(ex_data) ## Rows: 6 ## Columns: 2 ## $ color &lt;chr&gt; &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot; ## $ car &lt;chr&gt; &quot;corvette&quot;, &quot;chevelle&quot;, &quot;camaro&quot;, &quot;corvette&quot;, &quot;chevelle&quot;, &quot;gto&quot; ex_data %&gt;% mutate(across(c(color, car),factor)) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## color car ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 red corvette ## 2 blue chevelle ## 3 green camaro ## 4 red corvette ## 5 green chevelle ## 6 yellow gto # round multiple columns to 1 decimal place mtcars %&gt;% mutate(across(c(disp:qsec),round,1)) %&gt;% head() ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.9 2.6 16.5 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.9 2.9 17.0 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.9 2.3 18.6 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.1 3.2 19.4 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.1 3.4 17.0 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.8 3.5 20.2 1 0 3 1 3.8 Pivoting (i.e., transposing) data 3.8.1 Condense multiple rows into a single column (pivot wide to long) Rearranging data like this can make it easier to work with and analyze. Example below from my gradebook for stats (exported from Canvas), with fake names. The command structure is as follows: pivot_longer( # Transpose LENGTHWISE by.... cols = everything(), # Taking ALL variable names... names_to=&quot;variable&quot;, # ...and dumping them into this new variable/column values_to=&quot;missing_count&quot;) #...and placing their values in this other new column NOTE!!! Pivoting data from wide to long like this expands the number of rows to make a matrix so that (for example, each student now has as a row for each assignment). Therefore, you can only pivot longways (or wide) ONCE, otherwise you will make duplicates. If you need to pivot multiple columns, just include all of the columns in one single pivot; do not use two separate, back to back pivot commands.

If you want to actually change them, youll need to combine this command with something like the sub() or gsub() commands (for base R). Im going to skip this becauseits base R. To access and change the names faster via tidyverse, run use rename() rm(list=ls()) # clear R&#39;s memory iris %&gt;% rename(&quot;hurr&quot;=&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;durr&quot;=&quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;abcdefgh&quot;=&quot;Species&quot;) %&gt;% head() ## hurr durr Petal.Length Petal.Width abcdefgh ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa If you need to do some really fancy conditional renaming (e.g., changing all variables that start with r to start with rf instead, to make it more clear that the prefix actually stands for risk factor rather than reverse coded), youll need to use rename_with(). This command has two parts to it: the data set, and the function you wish to apply to it (which you put after the ~) rename_with(iris, ~ gsub(pattern = &quot;.&quot;, replacement = &quot;_&quot;, .x, fixed = TRUE)) %&gt;% head() ## Sepal_Length Sepal_Width Petal_Length Petal_Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa The gsub() function from Base R identifies matching patterns in the data and substitutes them with what you want instead. Think of it like Rs version of Find/Replace from Microsoft Word. The above line of code thus does the following: 1. First, it checks the column names of the supplied data set (iris) for a specific pattern (specified in pattern= ) 2. Then it replaces that pattern with your input in replacement= The great thing about rename_with() is that the .fn (or ~ for short) can take ANY function as input. For example, if you want to add an element to the column names rather than replace something, (e.g., a prefix or suffix), you can change the function to: rename_with( iris, ~ paste0(.x, &quot;_text&quot;)) %&gt;% head() ## Sepal.Length_text Sepal.Width_text Petal.Length_text Petal.Width_text Species_text ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa The above line adds a suffix. You can also add a prefix in the exact same way, just by switching the order of the string and the pattern in the paste0 command. Alternative method to the above This is a second way to do the above. It may appear more simple, but its also probably not as theoretically consistent with how the packages were made..it uses the stringr package to rename the column names, and stringr is typically used for editing vectors of strings in a data set. so it works, but its a little unconventional because you call and edit the column names like you would a variable in your data set. colnames(iris)=str_replace(colnames(iris), pattern = &quot;.&quot;, replacement = &quot;_&quot;) In short: rename() and rename_with() are for renaming variables, as their names imply. The str_ verbs from the stringr package are for editing string-based variabels in your data set. Either works though with a little ingenuity. 3.11 Re-order columns in a data set Use relocate() to change column positions. If you need to move multiple columns at once, this command uses the same syntax as select(). mtcars # notice the column order ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 mtcars %&gt;% relocate(hp:wt, .after= am) %&gt;% head() ## mpg cyl disp qsec vs am hp drat wt gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 16.46 0 1 110 3.90 2.620 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 17.02 0 1 110 3.90 2.875 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 18.61 1 1 93 3.85 2.320 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 19.44 1 0 110 3.08 3.215 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 17.02 0 0 175 3.15 3.440 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 20.22 1 0 105 2.76 3.460 3 1 3.12 Date and time variables Formatting a column of dates can be extremely helpful if you need to work with time data, but also an extreme pain in the ass if its not stored correctly. This tutorial will be divided into two parts to cover both scenarios that you could encounter. It requires things to be done in two stages, and very precisely. 3.12.1 Date-time objects If youre lucky enough to have a vector of date-times, like what Qualtrics gives you, this will be brainless. Just do the following: example_datetime_data=tibble::tribble(~datetime, &quot;2010-08-03 00:50:50&quot;, &quot;2010-08-04 01:40:50&quot;, &quot;2010-08-07 21:50:50&quot;) head(example_datetime_data) # stored as character string ## # A tibble: 3 x 1 ## datetime ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2010-08-03 00:50:50 ## 2 2010-08-04 01:40:50 ## 3 2010-08-07 21:50:50 # Tidyverse lubridate::as_date(example_datetime_data$datetime) ## [1] &quot;2010-08-03&quot; &quot;2010-08-04&quot; &quot;2010-08-07&quot; 3.12.2 Date-only objects If youre unlucky enough to have only dates, and said dates are written in the traditional x/x/xxxx format, this will be an annoyance that has to be done in two stages. First, assuming your data is already imported and is being stored as a vector of character strings, you have to tell R to adjust the formatting of dates. You cannot change it from a character-based object into a Date or DateTime one until it recognizes the correct formatting. example_date_data=tibble::tribble(~X1, ~X2, &quot;8/4/2021&quot;, -49.87, &quot;8/4/2021&quot;, -13.85, &quot;8/3/2021&quot;, -7.45, &quot;8/3/2021&quot;, -172.71) # Correct formatting example_date_data$X1=format(as.POSIXct(example_date_data$X1,format=&#39;%m/%d/%Y&#39;),format=&#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) head(as_tibble(example_date_data)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## X1 X2 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2021-08-04 -49.9 ## 2 2021-08-04 -13.8 ## 3 2021-08-03 -7.45 ## 4 2021-08-03 -173. In the code above, note that there are two format commands: The first one tells R how the date data is currently being stored, while the second at the end tells it how you want it to be stored. In this case, we are changing it from the way we would usually hand write a date (e.g., 10/26/1993) to a format commonly recognized and used in Excel and stats software (1993-10-26). If your column also has times in it, you also need to include that too! Second, you can now correct the objects structure. You can do this with base Rs as.Date() or tidyverses date() verbs. # Tidyverse example_date_data$X1= lubridate::date(example_date_data$X1) # Base R version example_date_data$X1=as.Date(example_date_data$X1) Notice how the object is now stored as the correct type in the table above. NOTE! This entire process has been included in the tidy_date() command in my package, legaldmlab. 3.12.3 Find the difference between two dates/times difftime(part_1$end_date[1], part_2$end_date[1], units=&quot;days&quot;) 3.13 Reverse-code a variable To reverse-score a variable, you should use car::recode() Can be done a few different ways, depending on how many variables youre looking to recode: # Recode just one variable df$column=recode(df$column,&quot;1 = 7 ; 2 = 6 ; 3 = 5 ; 5 = 3 ; 6 = 2 ; 7 = 1&quot;) # Recode a select bunch of variables df=df %&gt;% mutate(across(c(family_close : family_feelings), recode, &quot;1 = 7 ; 2 = 6 ; 3 = 5 ; 5 = 3 ; 6 = 2 ; 7 = 1&quot;)) 3.14 Dummy coding (the very fast and easy way) Use dplyrs pivot_wider in conjunction with mutate to very quickly and automatically dummy code a column with any number of unique values. The middle part of the code below is what you needjust copy and paste it, and tweak the specifics library(tidyverse) mtcars |&gt; mutate(car=rownames(mtcars)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(n=1) |&gt; tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = cyl, values_from = n, names_prefix = &quot;number_cyl&quot;, values_fill = list(n=0)) |&gt; select(car, starts_with(&quot;number_&quot;)) |&gt; head() #truncate output for easier reading ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## car number_cyl6 number_cyl4 number_cyl8 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Mazda RX4 1 0 0 ## 2 Mazda RX4 Wag 1 0 0 ## 3 Datsun 710 0 1 0 ## 4 Hornet 4 Drive 1 0 0 ## 5 Hornet Sportabout 0 0 1 ## 6 Valiant 1 0 0 3.15 Create a relative ranking among several variables If you want to create a variable that is an ordinal ranking of other variables, first you need to make sure your data is long-wise. Then, depending on the type of ranking system you want, youll might need a different ranking command. The min_rank command from dplyr works in a manner similar to base Rs rank command. It ranks things like you see in sporting events. For example, if there is a clear winner in a game but 3 people tie for second place, the ranks would look like this: 1,2,2,2,4,5. Notice that the positions are independent from the counts. Using the same example from above, if you want the ranks to have no gaps (i.e. 1,2,2,2,3,4), you need to use dplyrs dense_rank command. In either case, the ranks are generated from lowest to highest, so if you want to flip them around youll need to include desc() in the command. dat=tibble::tribble(~name, ~score, &quot;bob&quot;, 0, &quot;bob&quot;, 5, &quot;bob&quot;, 50, &quot;bob&quot;, 50, &quot;bob&quot;, 50, &quot;bob&quot;, NA, &quot;alice&quot;, 70, &quot;alice&quot;, 80, &quot;alice&quot;, 90, &quot;alice&quot;, 20, &quot;alice&quot;, 20, &quot;alice&quot;, 1) dat %&gt;% mutate(ranked = dense_rank(desc(score))) ## # A tibble: 12 x 3 ## name score ranked ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 bob 0 8 ## 2 bob 5 6 ## 3 bob 50 4 ## 4 bob 50 4 ## 5 bob 50 4 ## 6 bob NA NA ## 7 alice 70 3 ## 8 alice 80 2 ## 9 alice 90 1 ## 10 alice 20 5 ## 11 alice 20 5 ## 12 alice 1 7 3.16 Manipulating the working environment and many things at once 3.16.1 Stuff the WHOLE working environment into a list files=mget(ls()) 3.16.2 Extract everything from a list into the environment list2env(cog_data, globalenv()) 3.16.3 Delete everything in the entire environment, except for one item rm(list=setdiff(ls(), &quot;cog_data&quot;)) # delete everything in the local environment except the final data set 3.17 Wrangling Lists 3.17.1 Nesting Imagine the concept of Russian Dolls, applied to data sets. You can manage data sets more effectively my collapsing them into a single tiny, mini data frame, and stuffing that inside of another one. This is done via nesting Effectively, you smush/collapse everything down so it fits inside one column. You can unnest to expand this data back out later when you need it, and keep it collapsed when you dont. This works because a vector/column in a data frame is a list of a defined length; and a data frame is thus simply a collection of lists that are all the same length. You can store anything in a data frame. You can keep the df connected to the model, which makes it very easy to manage a whole slew of related models You can use functional programming (i.e., iterative functions) to map functions or combinations of functions in new ways. Moreover and more importantly, when you use purrr to map functions onto multiple models or objects simultaneously, youre doing it to all of them at once with a single command, and the objects are kept together while you do it. This limits the mistakes you can make (e.g., copying and pasting code and forgetting to tweak something important; applying a function to the wrong object or set of objects by accident), and also reduces unnecessary code in your script. Converting data into tidy data sets gives you a whole new way (and easier way) to manage lots of information head(mtcars |&gt; nest(crap=vs:carb)) ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec crap ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 21 6 160 110 3.9 2.62 16.5 &lt;tibble [1 x 4]&gt; ## 2 21 6 160 110 3.9 2.88 17.0 &lt;tibble [1 x 4]&gt; ## 3 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.32 18.6 &lt;tibble [1 x 4]&gt; ## 4 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.22 19.4 &lt;tibble [1 x 4]&gt; ## 5 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.44 17.0 &lt;tibble [1 x 4]&gt; ## 6 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.46 20.2 &lt;tibble [1 x 4]&gt; 3.17.2 Combining/collapsing list levels (Reducing) demo_vars=files |&gt; map(import_spss) |&gt; reduce(left_join, by=&quot;catieid&quot;) "],["clean-data.html", "Chapter 4 Clean Data 4.1 Replace a value with NA 4.2 Replace NAs with a value 4.3 Identify columns or rows with Missing values 4.4 Find the percentage of a variable that is missing 4.5 Exclude Missing values from analysis 4.6 Dropping Missing values from the data set", " Chapter 4 Clean Data 4.1 Replace a value with NA Use dplyr::na_if() if you have a value coded in your data (e.g., 999) that you want to convert to NA example_data=dplyr::tribble(~name, ~bday_month, &quot;Ryan&quot;, 10, &quot;Z&quot;, 3, &quot;Jen&quot;, 999, &quot;Tristin&quot;, 999, &quot;Cassidy&quot;, 6) example_data ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## name bday_month ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Ryan 10 ## 2 Z 3 ## 3 Jen 999 ## 4 Tristin 999 ## 5 Cassidy 6 example_data$bday_month=na_if(example_data$bday_month, 999) #example doing one column at a time example_data ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## name bday_month ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Ryan 10 ## 2 Z 3 ## 3 Jen NA ## 4 Tristin NA ## 5 Cassidy 6 example_data %&gt;% # can also pass the data to mutate and do it the tidyverse way mutate(bday_month=na_if(bday_month, 999)) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## name bday_month ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Ryan 10 ## 2 Z 3 ## 3 Jen NA ## 4 Tristin NA ## 5 Cassidy 6 4.2 Replace NAs with a value tidyr::replace_na() is very useful if you have some NAs in your data and you want to fill them in with some value. example_data=tibble::tribble(~name, ~fav_color, ~fav_food, &quot;Ryan&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;Mexican&quot;, &quot;Cassidy&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, NA, &quot;Z&quot;, NA, NA, &quot;Tristin&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, NA, &quot;Tarika&quot;, NA, NA, &quot;Jen&quot;, NA, &quot;Italian&quot;) example_data ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## name fav_color fav_food ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Ryan green Mexican ## 2 Cassidy blue &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 Z &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 Tristin purple &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 Tarika &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 Jen &lt;NA&gt; Italian # replace NA&#39;s in one col tidyr::replace_na(example_data$fav_food, &quot;MISSING&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Mexican&quot; &quot;MISSING&quot; &quot;MISSING&quot; &quot;MISSING&quot; &quot;MISSING&quot; &quot;Italian&quot; # replace in multiple columns example_data %&gt;% mutate(across(c(fav_color, fav_food), replace_na, &quot;MISSING&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## name fav_color fav_food ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Ryan green Mexican ## 2 Cassidy blue MISSING ## 3 Z MISSING MISSING ## 4 Tristin purple MISSING ## 5 Tarika MISSING MISSING ## 6 Jen MISSING Italian 4.3 Identify columns or rows with Missing values is.na() is the base R way to identify, in a TRUE/FALSE manner, whether or not there are missing values in a vector y &lt;- c(1,2,3,NA) is.na(y) # returns a vector (F F F T) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE 4.4 Find the percentage of a variable that is missing Sometimes necessary to check before conducting an analysis.

Layer There is no piping involved in ggplot. You simply invoke ggplot, and tell it what they dataset is. Then you specify the aesthetics, and then the mapping. Lastly, include other optional stuff (e.g. expanded y-axis scale; titles and legends; etc.) Every single plot has the exact same layout that ONLY USES the above three points: ggplot(dataframe, aes(graph dimensions and variables used)) + geom_GraphType(specific graph controls) ## OR ## ggplot(dataframe) + geom_GraphType(aes(graph dimensions and variables used), specific graph controls) # mapping= aes() can go in either spot Then if you have other stuff you want to add on top of this, like axis labels, annotations, highlights, etc., you keep adding those in separate lines 7.1 Commands for ggplot graph types Graph Type Geom command Scatter geom_point() Line geom_line() Box geom_boxplot() Bar geom_bar() Column geom_col() Histogram geom_histogram() Density curve geom_density() Note that bar and column graphs look identical at first glance, but they serve two different purposes.

Option 1 is graph_sem() from the tidySEM package. tidySEM::graph_sem(fit1) Option 2 is from the easystats suite plot(parameters::parameters(fit1)) ## Using `sugiyama` as default layout 7.2.2 Bayes stuff Quick highlights here of my favorite functions from this package. See (ha) the full package overview at this link You can adjust the colors of the figures by setting them yourself (with scale_fill_manual), or by using the appropriate scale_fill command 7.2.2.1 Probability of Direction (Pd) figure Use plot(pd()) to visualize the Probability of Direction index. plot(bayestestR::pd(fit1))+ scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;#FFC107&quot;, &quot;#E91E63&quot;))+ theme_classic()+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = &quot;italic&quot;)) 7.2.2.2 ROPE figure plot(fit1, rope_color = &quot;grey70&quot;)+ gameofthrones::scale_fill_got_d(option = &quot;white_walkers&quot;) # scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;gray75&quot;,&quot;red&quot;) ROPE tests are plots of distributions, and therefore use scale_fill_xyz_d commands. (the d stands for discrete). You can use any scale theme color set from any package, as long as it ends in _d values=c(#FFC107, #E91E63) is the default bayestestR theme colors from their website 7.2.2.3 Bayes factor models comparison figure plot(bayesfactor_models(Thesis_Model,discount_model))+ scale_fill_flat(palette = &quot;complement&quot; , reverse = TRUE)+ # scale color adjustment 7.2.3 Histograms and density curves Since I use these so often I figure they deserve their own special section. Basic histograms can be built with the following code: ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=cyl)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, colour=&quot;Black&quot;, fill=&quot;green&quot;) + # histogram theme_classic() and your basic density curve with the following: ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price)) + geom_density(alpha=.3)+ # density plot. Alpha sets the transparency level of the fill. theme_classic() You can also use the following code from bayestestR to build a really quick and nice density curve plot(bayestestR::point_estimate(diamonds, centrality=c(&quot;median&quot;,&quot;mean&quot;)))+ labs(title=&quot;Mean and Median&quot;) 7.3 Highlight specific points The gghighlight package is great for this # example 1 ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp))+ geom_point()+ theme_classic()+ ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = mtcars, aes(label = hp))+ # add data labels (optional) gghighlight::gghighlight(hp &gt; 200) # add highlights, according to some criteria # example 2 diamonds_abr=diamonds %&gt;% slice(1:100) ggplot(diamonds_abr, aes(x= cut, y= price, colour=price))+ geom_point()+ theme_classic()+ ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = diamonds_abr, aes(label = price))+ # this line labels gghighlight::gghighlight(cut %in% c(&quot;Very Good&quot;, &quot;Ideal&quot;)) #this line highlights 7.4 Add labels to data points ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp))+ geom_point()+ theme_classic()+ ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = mtcars, aes(label = hp)) ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp))+ geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=hp, hjust=2.5, vjust=2.5)) #geom_label(aes(label = scales::comma(n)), size = 2.5, nudge_y = 6) 7.5 Plotting multiple graphs at once see::plots() is good for this. print(&quot;temp&quot;) ## [1] &quot;temp&quot; 7.6 Change the colors (bars; columns; dots; etc.) This can be done in at least two different ways, depending on your goal. To change the fill color by factor or group, add fill = ___ within the aes() command. If you want to add color and/or fill to a continuous variable, do that within the geom_density() command. If you want to add color and make all of the (bars; dots; lines; etc.) the same color, than that is a graph-wide control and needs to be put in geom_point(). This manually sets the color for the whole graph. # add a color scale to the dots ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp))+ geom_point(color=&quot;blue&quot;) If you want to add color that changes according to a variable (e.g., by factor level), then the color needs to be specified as a variable name, in the aes mapping with the other variables. ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp, color=cyl))+ geom_point() 7.6.1 Fine-tuning colors You can change the spectrum of colors to specific colors if you want. Useful for example, when making graphs for APLS presentations; you can change the colors to be Montclair State University themed. When changing the color scale of graphs, note that scale_fill commands are used for representing nominal data, while scale_color commands are for representing continuous data. As such, you use scale_fill to fill in area on a graph that shows a whole category or distinct things; and scale_color to use gradients of color to show changes in continuous data. For figures that have solid area (e.g., density; box; bar; violin plots; etc.), use scale_fill For figures that have continuous changes (e.g., line and scatter plots), use scale_color # Set colors manually ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(gear), fill=factor(carb)))+ geom_bar() + scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)) ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color=as.factor(cyl)))+ geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values=c(&quot;#999999&quot;, &quot;#E69F00&quot;, &quot;#56B4E9&quot;)) # Use color scales from a package library(gameofthrones) # NOTICE THAT scale_fill AND scale_color STILL APPLY TO THEIR RESPECTIVE GRAPH TYPES # bar graphs ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(gear), fill=factor(carb)))+ geom_bar() + scale_fill_got(discrete = TRUE, option = &quot;Tully&quot;) ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill=factor(vs)))+ geom_bar() + scale_fill_got(discrete = TRUE, option = &quot;Daenerys&quot;) # scatter plot ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp, colour = hp))+ geom_point(size = 2) + scale_colour_got(option = &quot;Lannister&quot;) Fill graphs also come with an extra option: Setting the outline color. You can change the outline of the bar/column/etc. by specifying the color inside geom_x() # change only the fill of the bars ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(gear), fill=factor(carb)))+ geom_bar() # Change the outline of the bars by adding color inside the geom_bar() command ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(gear), fill=factor(carb)))+ geom_bar(color=&quot;black&quot;) 7.6.2 More options with the see package See this link for setting color gradients for continuous variables, or using other custom color palattes like the gameofthrones package. Check out the see package for some good color scales; the commands for which are here. Incidentally, see is great not only for regular ggplot graphs, but also Bayesian stats graphs link; effect size graphs link; correlation graphs link; and more. 7.7 Other aesthetic mappings shape() controls the shapes on the graph alpha() controls transparency size() controls size Note again that if you want it to change by variable, it goes INSIDE aes(); but if you want to set it manually for the whole graph, it goes in geom_x() # shape ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp, shape=as.factor(cyl)))+ geom_point() ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp))+ geom_point(shape=23) # transparency ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp, alpha=hp))+ geom_point() # size ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp, size=cyl))+ geom_point() 7.8 Adding and Customizing Text 7.8.1 Add a title, axis labels, and captions All three can be added with labs(). ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=cyl))+ geom_bar(colour=&quot;gray&quot;, fill=&quot;lightgreen&quot;)+ labs(title = &quot;Ages of Survey Respondants by Group&quot;, x=&quot;Age Group&quot;, caption=&quot;Note.

Again, this is just a single extra command, this time at the end of the code: facet_wrap(~columnhead) The tilde sign in R means by, as in divide (something) by this print(&quot;temp&quot;) This line produces a graph of population and life expectency, breaking it down to make a separate graph per each continent 7.11 Log transformations Sometimes when your data is really squished together on a graph it is hard to read. In this case, log transformations are really helpful, to change the scale of the data. For example, by multiplying all your points by 10x To create a log transformation of the same scatter plot above, add one extra bit: scale_x_log10() print(&quot;temp&quot;) You can also make both axis be logged by adding +scale again for y 7.12 Changing the scale of the axis Add coord_cartesian(xlim = c(lower,upper)) print(&quot;temp&quot;) ## [1] &quot;temp&quot; 7.13 Add a regression line Add the line geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x) ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= mpg, y=hp, color=mpg))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, formula = y ~ x) 7.14 Save a graph or figure Use the

Slightly more complicated example Reading a table into R takes a few steps. Step 1 is to copy and paste the URL into the read_html() verb like below: pacman::p_load(rvest, tidyverse) exonerations_table=read_html(&quot;https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx&quot;) %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;table.ms-listviewtable&quot;) %&gt;% html_table(fill=TRUE, header = TRUE) Sometimes if the web page is extremely basic and pretty much the only thing on it is a table, you can stop there. Most of the time though, there will be tons of other stuff on the website and you need to get more specific so R can find the table. This is the html_nodes() part of the above command; in there you specify the exact part of the web page where the table is located/what object file it is. To find this you will need to use the Developer mode in your browser. See this screenshot for an example knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;pics&quot;, &quot;scrape.png&quot;)) In Firefox you open this by going to Settings &gt; More Tools &gt; Web Developer Tools (or CNTRL + Shift + I). Begin by looking through the console in the center bottom for names that look like they would be related to your table. A good place to start might be  , which contains the main body of the web page. Click on a name to expand it and see all the elements on the page contained there. Ultimately what youre looking for is what you see above: an element that, when selected, highlights ONLY the area of the web page youre looking for. To get at this you will need to keep expanding, highlighting, and clicking repeatedly.it can take some digging. Keep drilling down through page elements until you find the one that highlights the table and just the table.

Write that name in the html_node command and read it into R. Thats stage 1.

You can literally make a function to do anything you want. General structure of a basic function: # example structure Function_name=function(argument){ Expressions return(output) } Argument is your input. It is the thing you want to perform the operation on. Expressions is the actual operation (or operations) you want to perform on the supplied argument return tells R to return the result of the Expression to you when done. This example function takes an input of numbers in the form of a vector and subtracts two from each. numbers=c(2,10,12,80) sub_2=function(x){ result= x - 2 return(result) } sub_2(numbers) ## [1] 0 8 10 78 We can also supply the function with a single number and it still works sub_2(100) ## [1] 98 Well this looks useful. So whats the bigger picture? One of the primary advantages of functions are that they can reduce a long and complex process, or a process that involves many steps, into a single line of code; thus, creating your own functions is a fast way to make your life easier down the line either at some point in the far future or even in just a few minutes, if you know you will be writing the code for some process two or more times. Take this script for instance. You can see from the circled parts that I needed to transform three different data sets in a similar way: knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;pics&quot;, &quot;repeat_process.jpg&quot;)) Yes, I could have just done a copy-paste of the original code and tweak it slightly each time. But that is time consuming, produces a sloppier and longer script, and introduces a lot more room for error because of the repeated code and extra steps. Better to write a single function that could be applied to all three. In short, use functions to reduce a multi-step process or a process that youre implementing &gt;=2 times in a single script into one command. This saves you space and makes the script shorter; it saves you the trouble and effort of re-writing or adapting code from earlier sections; and importantly, reduces the chances of you making a coding error by proxy of the former two. As a quick example, I was able to replace each of the circled paragraphs of code above with a custom function that ran everything in one simple line. Now instead of 3 whole (and redundant) paragraphs, I now have 3 short lines, like so. na_zero_helpreint=rotate_data(data = na_zero_helpreint, variable_prefix = &quot;reintegrate_&quot;) na_blank=rotate_data(data = na_zero_helpreint, variable_prefix = &quot;barrier_&quot;) na_zero=rotate_data(data = na_zero_helpreint, variable_prefix = &quot;barrier_&quot;) Limitations to your average, everyday functions. While reducing a whole process or sequence of commands is extremely useful, it still leaves a limitation. For instance, while we avoided copying and pasting whole paragraphs or processes, I still had to copy-paste the same function three times. This still leaves chances for error on the table, and it still leaves us with wasted lines that make the script longer. In general, when you want to perform some function or process multiple times on multiple items (as above where the same command is used three times on three different data frames), you need to use a for-loop or iterating function. These can reduce further unwanted redundancies by applying the function or process iteratively. Read on for more info. 10.2 For-loops A for loop is essentially a function that applies a function or given set of operations to multiple things at once, and returns an output of many items. For example, this code finds the means of every vector/column in a dataset by repeatedly applying the same code over and over to element i in the given list: df &lt;- tibble( a = rnorm(10), b = rnorm(10), c = rnorm(10), d = rnorm(10) ) output &lt;- vector(&quot;double&quot;, ncol(df)) # 1.Output. Create the object you want the results of the loop stored in. for (i in seq_along(df)) { # 2.Sequence of operations. &quot;For each item &#39;i&#39; along data frame&quot; output[[i]] &lt;- median(df[[i]]) # 3.Body:&quot;every individual item in &#39;output&#39; = the median of each col in df } output ## [1] 0.3771802 -0.5176346 0.4171879 0.5704655 Check out this book chapter for a great and detailed explanation of for-loops and functional coding. Although for loops are nice, they are unwieldy. R programmers typically use iterating functions instead. Examples of iterating functions are the lapply, vapply, sapply, etc. family of base R commands. But these can also be confusing and the commands are not great. The purrr package offers a better way to do iterating functions over base R; its the tidyverse way to make efficient and understandable for loops! If you have a need for a for-loop for something, see the next section instead on how to use purrr to make an iterative function. Important to understand conceptually what a for-loop is, but using them is impractical when you have purrr 10.3 purrr and Iterative Functions All notes here come from Charlotte Wickhams lecture tutorial below Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UlWJWfZO9M Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ozKTUho0A&amp;t=1210s purrrs map() series of functions offer a way to apply any existing function (even functions youve made) to multiple things at once, be it lists, data frame columns, individual items in vector, etc. In short, they are for doing the same type of task repeatedly in a very quick and efficient manner. They work in much the same way as for-loops, but are far simpler to write, and can be applied in the same way to solve the same problems. How to use purrr The structure of map() commands is the same as the others in the tidyverse: #option 1 map(data, function) # option 2 data %&gt;% map(function) As a quick example and to highlight why purrr is so much more efficient and easier to use than for-loops, look at the same example from before, now using map() instead of a for: df |&gt; map_dbl(median) ## a b c d ## 0.3771802 -0.5176346 0.4171879 0.5704655 A single line is all it took to get the same results! And, it follows tidyverse grammar structure. Now lets get into how it works. map() commands work like this: For each element of x, do f. So if you pass it object x and object x is. - A vector, it will perform function f on every item in the vector - A data frame, it will perform function f on every column in the data frame - A list, it will perform function f on every level in the list Etc., etc.; the point is it applies a function repeatedly to every element in the object you supply it with. So lets walk through a case example. 10.3.1 Reproducible example: Scraping web data This is an example walk through showing how we can use purrr to speed things up dramatically and/or reduce the use of unwanted, extra code in our scripts. In this guide Ill be building a table of LPGA Tour statistics from multiple webpages. The workflow for purrr goes like this: First, you want to figure out how to do each step of your process line-by-line, for a single item. The idea is to try and walk through each step of the process and see exactly what will need to be done each each step and what the code will like, before trying to code it all at once at a higher level. Once you have each step for the first item figured out, then you make functions for each step that condense that code down to one command. Lastly, apply each function from your individual steps to all items in your list by using purr::map().

And just like that, weve downloaded four different web pages, extracted the tabled info, and formatted them without copying and pasting any code. The same process for all four was only used one time to write the initial function. Just apply some final formatting to clean it up a bit and combine the separate data frames into a single, unified one. lpga_data= lpga_data %&gt;% reduce(left_join, by=&quot;name&quot;) %&gt;% # Combine all list levels into a single tibble, matching by the &quot;Name&quot; column select(-contains(&quot;rank.&quot;)) |&gt; rename(&quot;score_average&quot;=&quot;score_average_actual&quot;) # VOILA! head(lpga_data) ## name distance putt_average greens_hit rounds score_average ## 1 Emily Pedersen 281.768 1.869 72.8 28 72.036 ## 2 Nanna Koerstz Madsen 276.758 1.759 72.7 33 69.848 ## 3 Maude-Aimee Leblanc 275.393 1.826 69.6 28 72.107 ## 4 Yuka Saso 274.671 1.741 67.7 38 70.684 ## 5 Bianca Pagdanganan 274.640 1.851 65.8 25 72.840 ## 6 Madelene Sagstrom 274.488 1.755 69.6 41 70.317 10.3.2 Non-reproducible example (Juvenile Life Without Parole study) In the Juvenile Lifers study, there were a series of questions that participants rated on a scale of 0-100 in terms of difficulty. Part of our analysis involved taking the ratings on those variables and giving them relative rankings, so that each of the 6 variables in the series was rated from the least to most difficult, by participant. Now if we only needed to compute these rankings once this wouldnt have been any big deal; however, we needed to do it three times. Much of the same code and the same process would need to be copied and pasted, resulting in a very long, messy, harder to read script. With purrr however, we can reduce the redundancies to a minimum, saving time and reducing the chances of mistakes. Step 1. Just like before, the first step is to find a line-by-line solution for a single item, and then to generalize this into a shortcut function that can be applied to the any item i in a series of items. For the sake of brevity, Im going to skip most of that and just include the functions below. load(&quot;C:/Github Repos/Studies/JLWOP/Data and Models/jlwop_reentry_survey.RData&quot;) #### CREATE THE DATA SETS WE NEED#### na_blank=jlwop_reentry_survey # analysis 1 keeps the data as-is na_zero=jlwop_reentry_survey %&gt;% # supplementary analysis replaces the NA&#39;s with 0 mutate(across(c(barrier_housing:barrier_identification), replace_na,0)) rm(jlwop_reentry_survey) # remove old data set to avoid confusion #### Functions #### # transformation function to wrangle the data into proper formatting rotate_data=function(data, variable_prefix){ data=data %&gt;% pivot_longer( cols= starts_with(variable_prefix), # collect all the desired variables (i.e., columns).... names_to = &quot;variable&quot;, #...and put them into a new categorical variable called &quot;variable&quot; values_to = &quot;participant_score&quot;) %&gt;% # ...and store their values in a new variable called &quot;participant_score&quot; arrange(unique,participant_score) %&gt;% select(c(unique, participant_score, variable)) %&gt;% # keep only these 3 variables relocate(variable, .before = participant_score) # put the newly created variable up front return(data) } # creating the rankings for each variable; then transform data back to original structure rank_and_unpivot=function(data){ data=data %&gt;% group_by(unique) %&gt;% # group the scores so they can be ranked by participant mutate(rank1=dense_rank(participant_score), # create ranking variable rank=max(rank1,na.rm = TRUE) + 1 - rank1) %&gt;% # fix ranks by flipping to ascending order mutate(rank=factor(rank)) %&gt;% # convert rank to factor structure select(-rank1) # Pivot back to wide data=data %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = rank:participant_score) %&gt;% ungroup() # un-group the data and delete the generated names return(data) } Step 2. Again, like before, we want to combine all elements of interest into some object. Once we have that, we then pass said object to map() and supply the map call with our custom function. dfs=list(na_blank=na_blank, na_zero=na_zero) %&gt;% # create lists map(.f=rotate_data, variable_prefix = &quot;barrier&quot;) %&gt;% # apply custom function along whole list map(rank_and_unpivot) # again!! DO IT AGAIN! With another function this time. # extract list elements to make them data frames again list2env(dfs, globalenv()) rm(dfs) #discard list. It has fulfilled its purpose. And just like that, were done! 10.3.3 Example 3: Read/Import several files at once with map() Multiple ways you can do this. ################### Option 1: read all into the global environment, keeping them as SEPERATE df&#39;s ############### legaldmlab::read_all(path=&quot;Data Repository/Stats Data Repository/JASP files&quot;, extension = &quot;.csv&quot;) # Option 1.A: Squish ALL OBJECTS in the working environment into a list # Again, note the &quot;ALL OBJECTS&quot; part; make sure there are no functions or other things in the environment when you run this. files=mget(ls()) ############# Option 2: Read in all files as a LIST of df&#39;s, then stitch in the names ##################################### files=paste0(here::here(&quot;Data Repository&quot;, &quot;Stats Data Repository&quot;, &quot;JASP files&quot;, &quot;/&quot;), list.files(path=here::here(&quot;Data Repository&quot;, &quot;Stats Data Repository&quot;, &quot;JASP files&quot;), pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;)) files_list=files |&gt; map(readr::read_csv) names(files_list)=file.path(here::here(&quot;Data Repository&quot;, &quot;Stats Data Repository&quot;, &quot;JASP files&quot;)) |&gt; #specify file path as a string list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) |&gt; # pass the path string to list files; search in this location for files with this extension gsub(pattern=&quot;.csv&quot;, replacement = &quot;&quot;) # remove this pattern to save only the name # Option 2.A: Extract each data frame and put everything into the global environment list2env(cog_data, globalenv()) 10.4 Other purrr commands Note that map() always returns a list, and depending on the output that you want, you may need to use a variation of map(). These variations are as follows: Command Return map_lgl() logical vector map_int() integer vector map_dbl() double vector map_chr() character vector walk() only returns the side effects of a function 10.4.1 walk and walk2 Walk() is useful for when you just want to plot something or write a save file to your disk, etc. It does not give you any return to store something in the environment. You use it to write/read files, open graphics windows, and so on. Example: Writing multiple files at once Utilize purrr::walk2() to apply a function iteratively on TWO objects simultaneously. To save multiple .csv files with walk2, we need two distinct lists: 1. A list of data frames that we wish to export, 2. and the file paths, complete with the file names and extensions, for each file to be written. First create and define both list items. Then apply walk2() to pluck an element from list 1 and its corresponding element from list 2, and apply the write_csv function in for-loop fashion. # DEMO 1: Writing multiple plots at once # Create list one, the list of objects figs = list(scatter_plot=scatter_plot, multi_plot=multi_plot) # create list 2, the list of file names fig_names = figs |&gt; names() |&gt; map(paste0, &quot;.png&quot;) # pass both to purrr to use ggsave iteratively over both lists once and save all graphs with one command walk2(figs, fig_names, ~ggsave(plot = figs, filename = fig_names path=here::here(&quot;Figures and Tables&quot;), device = &quot;png&quot;, dpi = 300)) A second demo, this time using write.csv to save/export multiple CSV files at once # DEMO 2: Wrinting multiple .csv files at once ### Custom function #### # Create needed function that grabs file names and stitches them together with the correct path and extension # Included in legaldmlab package bundle_paths=function(df_list, output_location, file_type){ names=names(df_list) paths=rep(here::here(output_location), length(names)) extension=rep(c(file_type), length(names)) fixed_names=paste0(&quot;/&quot;,names) path_bundle=list(paths,fixed_names, extension) %&gt;% pmap(., paste0) return(path_bundle) } #### Exporting the .csv files for SPSS/JASP/etc. #### # Define list 1 dfs=list(na_blank=na_blank, na_zero=na_zero, na_zero_helpreint=na_zero_helpreint) # list 2 paths_csv=bundle_paths(df_list = dfs, folder_location = &quot;JLWOP/Data and Models&quot;, file_type = &quot;.sav&quot;) # Iterate over all elements in list 1 and corresponding element in list 2; # and apply the the write_csv function to each walk2(.x=dfs, .y= paths, .f=haven::write_sav) #### .RData file for R users #### # Combine multiple data frames into a single .RData file and export save(list = c(&quot;na_blank&quot;, &quot;na_zero&quot;, &quot;na_zero_helpreint&quot;), file = here::here(&quot;JLWOP&quot;, &quot;Data and Models&quot;,&quot;ranking_data.RData&quot;)) 10.4.2 map2 knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;pics&quot;, &quot;map2_a.png&quot;)) knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;pics&quot;, &quot;map2_b.png&quot;)) 10.4.3 pmap for when you have a bunch of shit This function is for iterating over three or more elements. As soon as you have &gt;2 items you have to iterate over, you need pmap(), which acts on a list object called .i instead of a list object. The list .i is a list of all the objects you want to iterate over. If you give it a list of 18 items, it iterates over all 18. If the list only has two things, it only acts on those two. She says its easiest to imagine the list as a data frame, and the columns of the data frame like the elements of that list. knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;pics&quot;, &quot;pmap.png&quot;)) knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;pics&quot;, &quot;pmap_2.png&quot;)) 10.5 Using purrr to manage many models Below is the full script I copied from Hadley Wickhams lecture, which you can watch here pacman::p_load(dplyr,purrr,tidyverse,gapminder) #### Workflow for managing many models in R #### # 1.

Seriously, once you learn it, theres no going back. New and dont know where to start? Read The R Markdown Cookbook. Amazing overview with tons of neat tricks and how-tos. This other source may also be of some help. Below are some quick tips for common tasks; but be sure to read the Cookbook above. 11.1 Important code chunk options cache: TRUE or FALSE. Do you want to save the output of the chunk so it doesnt have to run next time? Creates a cached folder in the directory. eval: Do you want to evaluate (i.e., run) the code in the chunk? echo: Do you want to print the code after its run? include: Do you want to include code output in the final output document? Setting to FALSE means the code does not appear in the output document, but it is still run. 11.2 Writing math equations and symbols 11.2.1 Greek symbols A few notes first: Math notation is done with dollar signs and forward slashes For Greek letters, just type the name of the letter: $\\mu$ for \\(\\mu\\) $\\sigma$ for \\(\\sigma\\) $\\alpha$ for \\(\\alpha\\) $\\pi$ for \\(\\pi\\) $\\rho$ for \\(\\rho\\) 11.2.2 Math notation $\\pm$ for ± $\\ge$ for  $\\le$ for  $\\neq$ for  11.2.3 Statistics notation 11.2.4 Writing in-line code Use the funny looking symbol on the tilde key that looks like this: ` To write in line, code, put one of those symbols on either side of the code, like you would with quotation marks. Helps you write lines like: I love dplyr 11.3 Including graphics/inserting pictures The default method doesnt work for me for some reason, but you can still insert images using a combination of the here package and knitr. Use the include_graphics() command and specify both the file location and its name: knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;pics&quot;,&quot;snapchat.png&quot;)) NOTE. Use 300-600 DPI to get good looking pictures. The bookdown book notes that: The syntax for controlling the image attributes is the same as when images are generated from R code. Chunk options fig.cap, out.width, and fig.show still have the same meanings. and: You can easily scale these images proportionally using the same ratio. This can be done via the dpi argument (dots per inch), which takes the value from the chunk option dpi by default If it is a numeric value and the chunk option out.width is not set, the output width of an image will be its actual width (in pixels) divided by dpi , and the unit will be inches. For example, for an image with the size 672 x 480, its output width will be 7 inches ( 7in ) when dpi=96. This feature requires the package png and/or jpeg to be installed. You can always override the automatic calculation of width in inches by providing a non-NULL value to the chunk option out.width , or use include_graphics(dpi = NA) 11.4 Footnotes To add a footnote, use the ^ symbol and put the note in brackets: You can also write footnotes1 like this. 11.5 Change the color of your text YOUR TEXT HERE 11.6 Re-using code chunk options https://yihui.org/en/2021/05/knitr-reuse/ 11.7 Making better tables https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/11/how-to-make-beautiful-tables-in-r/ 11.8 Running in-line code To run code in the middle of a sentence, you create a mini code chunk inside the sentence.

For 3+ raters on a continuous variable, use Intraclass Correlation. See this page. 12.3 Statistical tests and modeling with easystats https://easystats.github.io/easystats/ 12.3.1 Getting parameter estimates from model objects Scenario: Youve run some statistical test (like the below regression), and want a summary of the model estimates. rm(iris) model &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris) You have a few options when it comes to getting a summary of a model and getting the coefficient estimates: - summary() - broom::tidy() - paramters::model_paramters(), or just paramters::paramters() for short Theres no reason to use summary, generally speaking, because it sucks. It doesnt give you tidy output thats easy to manipulate or extract, its hard to read, and it cant be turned into a useful table. Skip it unless you need something specific from its output (i.e., youre using lavaan) Options two and three are pretty similar and both give you most of the same information, though parameters() prints neater to the console window. Generally I find parameters preferable. Note though that neither command will round the numbers if you store it as a table in the environment. So. If you want to manipulate ANY info in the table and/or extract info, use tidy or parameters. Both make tidy tibbles. If youre using the command to export said info in a neat, presentable MS Word table or HTML table, and you do not care about extracting/modifying/manipulating anything in it, then use parameters and pipe it to format_table() Using format_table() rounds all columns to 2 decimal places, reformats p-values to APA format, and collapses CIs into a single column. Do note though that it makes every column into a Character column! So this is for exporting-use only. Heres a comparison of brooms output (first) vs. parameters (second) when you save each in the environment. As you can see, both produce tidy tibbles And heres what parameters(model) |&gt; format_table() does to the a parameters table: Much cleaner for making a table to export to Word. 12.3.2 Getting model information and performance metrics Again, two options here. You can use either glance from the broom package, or performance from the package of the same name. These each produce slightly different output, though unlike above, I dont think one is necessarily better than the other. Use whichever one you prefer. broom::glance(model) ## # A tibble: 1 x 12 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC deviance df.residual nobs ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0.619 0.614 0.515 119. 1.67e-31 2 -112. 231. 243. 39.0 147 150 performance::performance(model) ## # Indices of model performance ## ## AIC | BIC | R2 | R2 (adj.) | RMSE | Sigma ## ----------------------------------------------------- ## 231.452 | 243.494 | 0.619 | 0.614 | 0.510 | 0.515 12.3.3 Effect size info with effectsize logreg_model=glm(smoke ~ age + sex, data= legaldmlab::survey, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) logreg_model_coeff=parameters::parameters(logreg_model) logreg_model_coeff=logreg_model_coeff |&gt; dplyr::mutate(odds_ratio=exp(Coefficient)) effectsize::interpret_oddsratio(logreg_model_coeff$odds_ratio, rules = &quot;chen2010&quot;) ## [1] &quot;small&quot; &quot;very small&quot; &quot;very small&quot; ## (Rules: chen2010) 12.3.4 Quick, detailed, and automated reporting with report Check out https://easystats.github.io/report/ 12.3.5 Running correlations with correlation https://easystats.github.io/correlation/ "],["advanced-coding-tips.html", "Chapter 13 Advanced Coding Tips 13.1 Grammar and Syntax 13.2 Creating a package 13.3 Creating a bookdown", " Chapter 13 Advanced Coding Tips 13.1 Grammar and Syntax 13.1.1 Regex expressions and symbols str_remove(html$`Market Price`, pattern = &quot;$&quot;) # doesn&#39;t remove the $ sign str_remove(html$`Market Price`, pattern = &quot;\\\\$&quot;) # works 13.1.2 The colon-equals (:=) operator Sometimes when making a function you need to use the colon-equals operator, rather than just the normal &lt;- or = assignment operators Specifically, when you have multiple named arguments in your functionRead my question and someones answer on this blogpost: https://community.rstudio.com/t/help-creating-simple-function/109011/2 function(df, col, newCol_name){ # drop all NA&#39;s so the function can work properly df_NAdropped=df |&gt; drop_na({{col}}) # apply the function, saving it in a small tibble with only the outlier column and a key to join by outliers_key=df_NAdropped |&gt; dplyr::mutate(outliers=dplyr::if_else(round(abs({{col}}-median({{col}}))/(1.483*mad({{col}}, constant = 1)),2)&gt;2.24,1,0)) |&gt; select(subject_id, outliers) # join back together df=df |&gt; left_join(outliers_key, by=c(&quot;subject_id&quot;)) num.outliers=df |&gt; dplyr::filter(outliers==1) |&gt; dplyr::count() df$outliers=replace_na(df$outliers, 999) df=df |&gt; rename({{newCol_name}}:=&quot;outliers&quot;) message(paste0(num.outliers, &quot; outlier(s) detected&quot;)) return(df) } 13.1.3 User-supplied expressions or named columns in functions This is when you have to put double braces around something 13.1.4 When a command requires a named column or data set, but youve already supplied it and its required a second time If youre writing a function with a pipe but the command youre using needs the data set defined in it, you specify it as .x , or simply just .; Here is an example: 13.2 Creating a package https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/data-pkg.html 13.2.1 Documenting package meta-data https://r-pkgs.org/description.html 13.2.2 Connecting to other packages https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/depends.html 13.2.3 Linking Git and Github view this detailed guide by Jenny Bryan, and this YouTube video if you want the full guide; or just follow the TL;DR below.

DATA WITH NO DIFFERENCE AMONG GROUPS Critically important notes to know: When you use the rep() function, there are several different arguments you can specify inside it that control how stuff is repeated: using rep(x, each= ) repeats things element-wise; each element gets replicated n times, in order rep(c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;), each=3) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; using rep(x, times= ) repeats the sequence; the vector as a whole, as it appears, will be repeated with one sequence following the next rep(c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), times=3) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; using rep(x, length.out) repeats only the number of elements you specify, in their original order rep(c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), length.out=3) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; In this particular data, we want every combination of group and letter to be present ONCE. letters=c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) tibble(group = rep(letters[1:2], each = 3), factor = rep(LETTERS[3:5], times = 2), response = rnorm(n = 6, mean = 0, sd = 1) ) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## group factor response ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 A C -0.559 ## 2 A D 0.0378 ## 3 A E -1.14 ## 4 B C -1.10 ## 5 B D 0.509 ## 6 B E -0.304 14.2.2 2.b. Data WITH A DIFFERENCE among groups What if we want data where the means are different between groups? Lets make two groups of three observations where the mean of one group is 5 and the other is 10. The two groups have a shared variance (and so standard deviation) of 1. 14.2.2.1 Some notes first Creating a difference between the two groups average score means we have to tell R to sample itteratively from distributions with different means. We do this by specifying a vector of means within rnorm, like so: response = rnorm(n = 6, mean = c(5, 10), sd = 1) response ## [1] 4.066141 9.831952 4.307055 11.059641 4.808349 10.009015 You can see that: 1. draw 1 is from the distribution \\((\\mu=5,\\sigma=1)\\) 2. draw 2 is from the distribution \\((\\mu=5,\\sigma=1)\\) And this process repeats a total of six times. And if you happen to also specify a vector of standard deviations (purely to demonstrate what is happening, we wont actually do this), the first mean is paired with the first SD; the second mean is paired with the second SD; and so on. rnorm(n = 6, mean = c(5, 10), sd = c(2,0.1)) ## [1] 5.744356 10.043787 7.378609 9.952296 8.064520 10.119440 14.2.2.2 Ok, back to creating the data If you want there to be differences between the groups, we need to change the way the vector of factors is replicated, in addition to specifying the vector of means. We want to ensure that the sequence of A, B in the group column matches the sequence repeated in the response column. Here we are going to use length.out so that the whole sequence of A,B is repeated exactly in line with the alternating drawing from \\(\\mu=5\\), \\(\\mu=10\\). Its often best to do this by building each thing separately, and then combining it into a tibble when you have it figured out. group=rep(letters[1:2], length.out = 6) group ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; response=rnorm(n = 6, mean = c(5, 10), sd = 1) response ## [1] 4.948867 10.118024 3.109300 8.589811 4.047384 10.121841 tibble(group, response) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## group response ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 A 4.95 ## 2 B 10.1 ## 3 A 3.11 ## 4 B 8.59 ## 5 A 4.05 ## 6 B 10.1 14.2.3 2.c. Data with MULTIPLE QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES with groups 14.3 Part 3: Repeatedly simulate samples with replicate() Instead of drawing values one at a time from a distribution, we want to do it many times. This is a job for replicate(). What replicate() does is run a function repeatedly. The replicate() function will perform a given operation as many times as you tell it to. Here we tell it to generate numbers from the distribution \\(N~(\\mu=0, \\sigma=1)\\), three times (as specified in the n=3 argument in line one) replicate(n = 3, expr = rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1), simplify = FALSE ) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1.3203910 0.2040899 -0.7970636 -1.2431823 -0.4844866 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] -1.2322047 0.1063858 0.7922842 0.4413982 -0.8931153 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 1.7023983 0.1654943 0.7787761 -0.1186586 -0.2111680 The argument simplify=FALSE tells it to return the output as a list. If you set this to TRUE it returns a matrix instead replicate(n = 3, expr = rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1), simplify = TRUE ) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.72115635 0.7402300 0.1134487 ## [2,] 0.92810115 -1.1035296 -1.0247406 ## [3,] 0.53107386 0.0286275 -0.3009290 ## [4,] -0.01083094 0.5085364 1.7663764 ## [5,] -0.51711197 0.3824463 -1.0787283 Specifying as.data.frame() with the matrix output can turn it into a data frame. replicate(n = 3, expr = rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1), simplify = TRUE ) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% rename(sample_a=V1, sample_b=V2, sample_c=V3) ## sample_a sample_b sample_c ## 1 0.56415036 -1.7060196 1.1146509 ## 2 -0.24011787 1.8521680 1.4152690 ## 3 -0.09948105 1.9130434 0.1568660 ## 4 -1.76657069 -0.2574811 -1.0662388 ## 5 0.67864934 0.5891597 -0.1166993 14.4 Part 4: repeatedly making whole data sets This is combining parts 2 and 3 to repeatedly create and sample data sets, resulting in a list of many data sets. simlist = replicate(n = 3, expr = data.frame(group = rep(letters[1:2], each = 3), response = rnorm(n = 6, mean = 0, sd = 1) ), simplify = FALSE) simlist ## [[1]] ## group response ## 1 A -1.1482417 ## 2 A -0.5806775 ## 3 A 0.3688638 ## 4 B 0.3304444 ## 5 B 0.3483946 ## 6 B -1.1257075 ## ## [[2]] ## group response ## 1 A 0.8829318 ## 2 A -1.3660498 ## 3 A -0.7142761 ## 4 B -0.2700098 ## 5 B -0.2419871 ## 6 B -0.4623374 ## ## [[3]] ## group response ## 1 A -0.6018124 ## 2 A 1.0289143 ## 3 A 0.1779939 ## 4 B 1.7056511 ## 5 B -0.3255277 ## 6 B -0.7897194 14.5 Part 5: Using purrr See this blog post Kruschke, J.
