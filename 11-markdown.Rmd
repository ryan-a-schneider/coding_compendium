# Intro to R Markdown

R Markdown is a better and more organized way to write scripts. Seriously, once you learn it, there's no going back. New and don't know where to start? Read [The R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/conceptual-overview.html). Amazing overview with tons of neat tricks and how-to's. [This other source](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/using-rmarkdown.html#the-anatomy-of-an-rmarkdown-document) may also be of some help.

Below are some quick tips for common tasks; but be sure to read the Cookbook above.

## Important code chunk options

- `cache`: TRUE or FALSE. Do you want to save the output of the chunk so it doesn't have to run next time? Creates a cached folder in the directory.
- `eval`: Do you want to evaluate (i.e., run) the code in the chunk?
- `echo`: Do you want to *print* the code after it's run?
- `include`: Do you want to include code output in the final output document? Setting to `FALSE` means the code does not appear in the output document, but it is still run.

## Writing math equations and symbols

### Greek symbols

A few notes first:
Math notation is done with dollar signs and forward slashes...

For Greek letters, just type the name of the letter:
`$\mu$` for $\mu$
`$\sigma$` for $\sigma$
`$\alpha$` for $\alpha$
`$\pi$` for $\pi$
`$\rho$` for $\rho$

### Math notation

`$\pm$` for ±
`$\ge$` for ≥
`$\le$` for ≤
`$\neq$` for ≠

### Statistics notation

### Writing in-line code

Use the funny looking symbol on the tilde key that looks like this: `
To write in line, code, put one of those symbols on either side of the code, like you would with quotation marks. Helps you write lines like:

I love `dplyr`


## Including graphics/inserting pictures

The default method doesn't work for me for some reason, but you can still insert images using a combination of the `here` package and `knitr`.

Use the `include_graphics()` command and specify both the file location and it's name:
```{r 11.2}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pics","snapchat.png"))
```

***NOTE***. Use 300-600 DPI to get good looking pictures.

The [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html) notes that:

  The syntax for controlling the image attributes is the same as when images are generated from R 
  code. Chunk options `fig.cap`, `out.width`, and `fig.show` still have the same meanings. 

and:
  You can easily scale these images proportionally using the same ratio. This can be done via the 
  `dpi` argument (dots per inch), which takes the value from the chunk option `dpi` by default If it is a 
  numeric value and the chunk option `out.width` is not set, the output width of an image will be its 
  actual width (in pixels) divided by dpi , and the unit will be inches. For example, for an image with 
  the size 672 x 480, its output width will be 7 inches ( 7in ) when `dpi=96`. 
  This feature requires the package png and/or jpeg to be installed. You can always override the automatic calculation of 
  width in inches by providing a non-NULL value to the chunk option `out.width` , or use `include_graphics(dpi = NA)`



## Footnotes

To add a footnote, use the "^" symbol and put the note in brackets:

You can also write footnotes^[Kruschke, J. (2015). Goals, power, and sample size. In J. K. Kruschke (Ed.), Doing bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with r, jags, and stan (2nd ed., pp. 359-398). Academic Press.] like this.

## Running in-line code

To run code in the middle of a sentence, you create a mini code chunk *inside* the sentence. For example:
> There are 2x2 apples in the basket

Could be typed as...

There are `r 2*2` apples in the basket
