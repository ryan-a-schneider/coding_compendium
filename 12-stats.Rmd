# Statistics- and Psych-specific Stuff

## Create or sample from a distribution

If you want to generate a distribution of data to sample from, use the distribution functions that start with `r`. I will create a few different binomial distributions as examples.

Each distribution command has parameters you set to create the distribution. The binomial's has three:

-   `n`, the number of samples

-   `size`, the number of *trials* per sample

-   `prob`, the probability of a success on each individual trial

Note the definition of the `size` variable in particular. And imagine we are simulating a bunch of jury trials....

```{r chapter_12, eval=FALSE}

#### Example 1 ####
# 10 jury trials with 1 verdict each
rbinom(n=10, size = 1, prob = .7)

#### Example 2 ####
# 10 jury trials with 2 verdicts per trial. Each participant has 2 outcomes. 
rbinom(n=10, size = 2, prob = .7)


#### Example 3 ####
# 1 jury trial with 1 verdict 
rbinom(n=1, size = 1, prob = .7)

# or alternatively...
purrr::rbernoulli(n=1, p=.7)
```

The third example of `rbinom` is equivalent to creating a Bernoulli distribution, because a single binomial event *is* a Bernoulli event. One coin flip comes from a Bernoulli distribution....a series of 5 coin flips (i.e., trials) comes from a Binomial.

Here's an example where I generate 100 fake participants, and then for *each participant,* simulate a single Bernoulli event (a win or a loss at trial).

```{r eval=FALSE}
test=tibble(plea_rejectors=c(1:100),
       trial_outcomes=purrr::rbernoulli(n=length(plea_rejectors), p=.3)) |> 
  mutate(trial_outcomes=ifelse(trial_outcomes=="FALSE", "Loss", "Win"))
```

### Calculating Likelihood

If you already have data (or some idea of what the parameters are for a distribution) and you want to find the likelihood, use the density functions that start with `d`.

For likelihood of getting 6 wins out of 10 trials, and a 50% of winning on each trial, use the density function for a binomial distribution:

```{r}
dbinom(6, size=10, prob=0.5)
```

## Calculating Interrater reliability

***Cohen's Kappa*** is useful for IRR agreement on categorical variables...Use the `psych` package for this [see here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/psych/versions/2.1.6/topics/cohen.kappa); and read [this web page](https://www.statisticshowto.com/cohens-kappa-statistic/) for an overview of what Cohen's Kappa is if you need a recap/intro.

For 3+ raters on a continuous variable, use ***Intraclass Correlation***. See [this page](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/psych/versions/2.2.3/topics/ICC%5D%20for%20a%20function%20to%20calculate%20this).

## Statistical tests and modeling with `easystats`

### Getting parameter estimates from model objects

Scenario: You've run some statistical test (like the below regression), and want a summary of the model estimates.

```{r 12_model}
rm(iris)

model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
```

You have a few options when it comes to getting a summary of a model and getting the coefficient estimates: - `summary()` - `broom::tidy()` - `paramters::model_paramters()`, or just `paramters::paramters()` for short

*There's no reason to use `summary`, generally speaking, because it sucks. It doesn't give you tidy output that's easy to manipulate or extract, it's hard to read, and it can't be turned into a useful table. Skip it unless you need something specific from it's output (i.e., you're using lavaan)*

Options two and three are pretty similar and both give you most of the same information, though `parameters()` prints neater to the console window. Generally I find `parameters` preferable.

Note though that *neither command* will round the numbers if you store it as a table in the environment. So....

1.  If you want to manipulate ANY info in the table and/or extract info, use `tidy` or `parameters`. Both make tidy tibbles.
2.  If you're using the command to ***export*** said info in a neat, presentable MS Word table or HTML table, and you *do not care about extracting/modifying/manipulating anything in it*, then use `parameters` and pipe it to `format_table()`

Using `format_table()` rounds all columns to 2 decimal places, reformats p-values to APA format, and collapses CI's into a single column. Do note though that it makes every column into a Character column! So this is for exporting-use only.

Here's a comparison of broom's output (first) vs. parameter's (second) when you save each in the environment. As you can see, both produce tidy tibbles

```{r 12_pic1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pics", "tidy.png"))
```

```{r 12_pic2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pics", "parameters.png"))
```

And here's what `parameters(model) |> format_table()` does to the a parameters table:

```{r 12_pic3, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pics", "format_table.png"))
```

Much cleaner for making a table to export to Word.

### Getting model information and performance metrics

Again, two options here. You can use either `glance` from the broom package, or `performance` from the package of the same name. These each produce slightly different output, though unlike above, I don't think one is necessarily better than the other. Use whichever one you prefer.

```{r 12_broomdemo}
broom::glance(model)
```

```{r 12_perfdemo}
performance::performance(model)
```

### Effect size info with `effectsize`

```{r 12_effectsizedemo}
logreg_model=glm(smoke ~ age + sex, data= legaldmlab::survey, family = "binomial")
logreg_model_coeff=parameters::parameters(logreg_model)
logreg_model_coeff=logreg_model_coeff |> dplyr::mutate(odds_ratio=exp(Coefficient))
  
effectsize::interpret_oddsratio(logreg_model_coeff$odds_ratio, rules = "chen2010")
```
