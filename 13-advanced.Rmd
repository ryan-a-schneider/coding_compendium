# Coding Tips and Tricks


## Regular R stuff

### Regex expressions and symbols

```{r chapter_13, eval=FALSE}
str_remove(html$`Market Price`, pattern = "$") # doesn't remove the $ sign
str_remove(html$`Market Price`, pattern = "\\$") # works
```


### The new pipe (Base R)

## Tidyverse stuff

### Sometimes when making a function you need to use the colon-equals operator, rather than just the normal <- or = assignment operators

Specifically, when you have multiple named arguments in your function

## Function-related stuff

### User-supplied expressions or named columns in functions


### When a command requires a named column or data set, but you've already supplied it and it's required a second time
If you're writing a function with a pipe but the command you're using needs the data set defined in it, you specify it as .x
Here is an example:


### Formulas within functions

Generally when you see `.fn` inside a function (e.g., `map(x, .fn)`), that means *function*. You put whatever formula or function you want in there. You may also see the tilde used instead, which does the same thing.

### Rendering the book once it's done

1. Render locally with bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")

2. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

3. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub.
