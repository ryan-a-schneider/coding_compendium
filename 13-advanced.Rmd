## Regular R stuff

### Regex expressions and symbols

```{r chapter_13, eval=FALSE}
str_remove(html$`Market Price`, pattern = "$") # doesn't remove the $ sign

If you're writing a function with a pipe but the command you're using needs the data set defined in it, you specify it as .x
Here is an example:


### Formulas within functions

Generally when you see `.fn` inside a function (e.g., `map(x, .fn)`), that means *function*. You put whatever formula or function you want in there. You may also see the tilde used instead, which does the same thing.
